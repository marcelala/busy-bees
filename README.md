This app allows the user to add and remove parcels fetched from RESTful API to a tracking list, displaying their status and details. This project is a student project for KTH's Software Development Academy.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Set up

In the project directory, you can run:

        npm install

Which installs the projects dependencies. After that running

        npm start

the app runs in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Usage
At the home page it is possible to add the parcel tracking numbers to the list of parcels to be tracked. After that the details of each parcel will be displayed.
When the user decides tracking is no longer necessary the parcels can be removed from the list.
